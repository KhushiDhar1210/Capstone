**HexFit: Personalized Outfit Recommendations Based on Unique HEX Color Palette**

**- Khushi Dhar**

This project seeks to re-define Seasonal Colour Analysis by leveraging HEX codes and LLMs to determine optimal color palettes for individuals and their outfit recommendations. The model will primarily take face dataset as input, processes it for emotion detection and HEX codes and then recommends the personâ€™s season and which outfit colours would look good on them. Key components include:

â€¢ CNN-based supervised learning for Emotion Detection.

â€¢ K-means unsupervised learning supported by HSV mask for Skin Tone Extraction and Analy sis and further converting the RGB distribution to HEX codes.

â€¢ LLM-based color Interpretation of seasonal palettes and suggestions for colors aligning with the userâ€™s emotions as well. 

â€¢ Extraction of colour recommendations from LLMâ€™s response and keyword matching to dataset for finding best outfits.

The architecture of the model is defined in the image below:

# **HexFit: Personalized Outfit Recommendations Based on Unique HEX Color Palette**

**By Khushi Dhar**

HexFit redefines **Seasonal Color Analysis** by integrating **HEX color codes**, **emotion detection**, and **LLMs** to recommend personalized outfit color palettes. The system uses facial inputs to detect **emotions**, extract **skin tones**, and determine the userâ€™s **seasonal color type**, ultimately suggesting **outfit colors** that align with both **personal coloring** and **current mood**.

## **Steps to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the repo and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/KhushiDhar1210/Capstone>
   cd HexFit
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebooks in order:**

   - **`Preprocess_Data.ipynb`**  
     This notebook handles the major preprocessing steps. It reduces additional data, does augmentation to increase lower represented classes and organizes the images in a proper structure.
   
   - **`Emotion_Detection.ipynb`**  
     This notebook uses a CNN-based model to detect emotions from facial expressions. The output helps incorporate **emotional context** for the upcoming color suggestions.

   - **`Hex_Detection.ipynb`**  
     This notebook uses **HSV filtering** and **K-means clustering** to detect the dominant skin tone from the face region. It converts the extracted RGB distribution to **HEX codes** for use in **seasonal color analysis**.

3. **Understand the output:**
   - Each notebook will display the results in cells, showing emotion analysis, and skin tone extraction in terms of HEX code.
   - In the final step of `Hex_Detection.ipynb`, you will get the **HEX color palette** that aligns with the detected skin tone, which can be used for **personalized outfit recommendations**.

## **Required Dependencies**

Create a Python environment and install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` includes key dependencies such as:
- `opencv-python` (for face detection)
- `tensorflow` (for emotion detection CNN)
- `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for image processing and visualization)
- `sklearn` (for K-means clustering)
- `transformers` (for LLM-related tasks)
  
*If you do not have a specific environment or setup, feel free to reach out for further setup instructions.*

## **Key Steps in the Project**

### **1. Emotion Detection**  
Facial emotion detection is performed using a pre-trained **CNN model**, which analyzes facial expressions to infer emotional states (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).

### **2. Skin Tone Detection**  
Using **HSV masking**, the skin region is isolated, and **K-means clustering** is applied on the RGB values to detect the **dominant skin color**. This color is then converted into a **HEX code**, suitable for matching to seasonal palettes.

### **3. Color Palette Generation**  
The **HEX code** for the skin tone is passed to an **LLM** (Large Language Model), which interprets the color based on seasonal color analysis, helping determine which **outfit colors** will complement the individualâ€™s skin tone and current emotional state.

---

## **Results & Visualizations**

In each notebook, the results of emotion detection and skin tone analysis are visualized using:
- **Bar charts** for emotion classification accuracy
- **RGB/HEX color swatches** for detected skin tone

Hereâ€™s an example output:
- **Input Image:** Facial image for emotion and skin detection
- **Detected Emotion:** e.g., "Happy"
- **Dominant Skin Tone:** HEX Code (e.g., #F1D0A9)

### Notes:
1. **Model Training:** Currently, the project relies on pre-trained models for both emotion detection and face extraction. Future work will involve training these models for enhanced accuracy.

2. **HEX Code Matching:** The color matching with outfits is still under development. Current demonstrations match HEX codes with sample clothing datasets.
